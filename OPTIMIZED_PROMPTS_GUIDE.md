# üöÄ OPTIMIZED PROMPTS FOR OPUS 4

## What's New

I've created **enhanced prompts** specifically tuned for Claude Opus 4 and short-term trading. These prompts get significantly better, more actionable insights.

## üìä Key Improvements

### 1. **Sentiment Analysis** - Enhanced
**Before:** Basic positive/negative analysis  
**Now:**
- ‚úÖ Distinguishes retail hype vs institutional interest
- ‚úÖ Identifies sentiment SHIFTS (improving/deteriorating)
- ‚úÖ Detects price-news divergence
- ‚úÖ Weights recent news more heavily
- ‚úÖ Assesses source credibility

**Example Output:**
```
"Sentiment improving sharply. Recent Bloomberg article on Q3 
beat + guidance raise driving institutional buying. Prior 
negative tone from retail forums now flipping. Key divergence: 
sentiment 8/10 but stock only up 2% = more upside ahead."
```

### 2. **Catalyst Identification** - Enhanced
**Before:** Generic event listing  
**Now:**
- ‚úÖ PRECISE timing estimates (days/weeks, not vague)
- ‚úÖ Expected MAGNITUDE (% price impact)
- ‚úÖ PROBABILITY assessment
- ‚úÖ "Already priced in" analysis
- ‚úÖ Identifies catalyst CLUSTERS
- ‚úÖ Pinpoints THE best catalyst

**Example Output:**
```
Best Catalyst: Earnings Nov 7 (12 days)
- Expected beat by 5-8%
- Probability: 70% (strong guidance signals)
- Expected Move: 8-12% on beat
- Already Priced In: No (stock flat despite sector strength)
- Cluster: Earnings + product launch same week
```

### 3. **Risk Assessment** - Enhanced
**Before:** Generic risk list  
**Now:**
- ‚úÖ TIMING of when risks could hit
- ‚úÖ Early WARNING SIGNALS to monitor
- ‚úÖ Hidden risks not obvious from headlines
- ‚úÖ Position sizing advice based on risk
- ‚úÖ Specific "biggest risk" to watch
- ‚úÖ Risk vs reward assessment

**Example Output:**
```
Biggest Risk: Patent expiration Q1 2026 (4 months)
Early Warning: Watch for generic competitors filing
Position Size: Medium (3-5%) due to moderate risk
Risk/Reward: Favorable - 15% upside vs 7% downside
```

### 4. **Bull/Bear Thesis** - Enhanced
**Before:** Generic reasons  
**Now:**
- ‚úÖ SHORT-TERM focused (< 2 months)
- ‚úÖ SPECIFIC to THIS stock (not generic)
- ‚úÖ Technical + Fundamental + Sentiment combined
- ‚úÖ Concrete entry/exit strategies
- ‚úÖ "What would change thesis" trigger
- ‚úÖ Honest conviction assessment

**Example Output:**
```
Bull Case (Stronger):
- Technical breakout above $147 resistance on 2x volume
- Earnings catalyst in 12 days with 70% beat probability  
- Insider buying last week (CFO bought $500k)

Entry: Buy $145-147 on any pullback
Exit: Target $165 (15% gain), Stop $138 (7% loss)
Hold: 2-3 weeks through earnings
```

### 5. **Trading Recommendation** - Enhanced
**Before:** Generic buy/hold/sell  
**Now:**
- ‚úÖ SPECIFIC entry prices/conditions
- ‚úÖ SPECIFIC profit targets AND stop losses
- ‚úÖ EXACT timeframe (days/weeks)
- ‚úÖ Position size based on risk/conviction
- ‚úÖ 3 watch points to monitor
- ‚úÖ "Plan B" if wrong
- ‚úÖ Fully actionable (execute immediately)

**Example Output:**
```
Recommendation: STRONG BUY
Confidence: High
Position Size: Medium (3-5% of portfolio)

Entry: $145-147 (current or slight pullback)
Profit Target: $165-170 (15% gain)
Stop Loss: $138 (7% below entry)
Timeframe: Hold 2-3 weeks until Nov 7 earnings

Watch Points:
1. Volume on breakout (needs >2M shares)
2. SPY correlation (if market tanks, exit)
3. Any negative pre-announcements

Alternative: If breaks $138, thesis is wrong - cut immediately.
```

### 6. **Comparative Ranking** - Enhanced

   Catalyst: Earnings + product launch next week
   Edge: Options flow shows institutions loading up
   
#2 AAPL - Safer play
   Entry: Wait for $175 pullback
   Catalyst: Services momentum + buyback
   Edge: Defensive if market sells off

## üéì Prompt Engineering Principles

### What Makes These Prompts Better:

1. **Specific > Vague**
   - ‚ùå "Analyze sentiment"
   - ‚úÖ "Score 0-10, identify shift, check divergence"

2. **Constrained > Open-ended**
   - ‚ùå "What are catalysts?"
   - ‚úÖ "List catalysts with timing, magnitude, probability"

3. **Actionable > Descriptive**
   - ‚ùå "This stock looks good"
   - ‚úÖ "Buy $145-147, target $165, stop $138, hold 2-3 weeks"

4. **Quantified > Qualitative**
   - ‚ùå "High risk"
   - ‚úÖ "Risk 4/10, position size 2-3%, stop 7% below"

5. **Time-bounded > Timeless**
   - ‚ùå "Long-term potential"
   - ‚úÖ "Hold 2-3 weeks until Nov 7 earnings"

6. **Honest > Optimistic**
   - ‚ùå "This will go up"
   - ‚úÖ "70% probability, but watch for these 3 risks"

## üî¨ Testing the Difference

### Run Both Versions:

1. **Run with standard prompts:**
```bash
# Backup standard version first
python main_with_claude.py input.txt --deep-analysis
# Save outputs to compare/
```

2. **Run with optimized prompts:**
```bash
# Use optimized version
python main_with_claude.py input.txt --deep-analysis
# Compare outputs
```

3. **Compare for same stock:**
- Are entries/exits more specific?
- Are catalysts more precise?
- Are recommendations more actionable?
- Can you execute based on recommendation alone?

## üéØ Bottom Line

### Standard Prompts:
"NVDA looks good, buy on dips, positive sentiment, multiple catalysts."

### Optimized Prompts:
"STRONG BUY NVDA. Entry: $495-500. Target: $570 (15%). Stop: $465 (7%). Hold 3 weeks until Nov 10 earnings. Position: Medium (4%). Catalyst: Earnings + new GPU launch Nov 12 (80% beat probability, 12-15% expected move, not priced in). Risk: Moderate (6/10) - Watch China export restrictions. Alternative: If breaks $465 pre-earnings, exit immediately."
