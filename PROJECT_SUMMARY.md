The system analyzes 7 key dimensions (each 0-10):

**Best for:** Catching trending stocks

- Volume spikes vs average
- Increasing volume trend
**Best for:** Finding institutional interest

### 3. Technical Score (Weight: 20%)
- RSI indicators
- Moving average crossovers
- Breakout detection
**Best for:** Entry/exit timing

### 4. Volatility Score (Weight: 10%)
- Sweet spot: 2-4% daily volatility
- Penalizes extremes (too low/high)
**Best for:** Risk-adjusted returns

### 5. Relative Strength Score (Weight: 15%)
- Performance vs SPY (market)
- Shows sector strength
**Best for:** Market-beating picks

### 6. Catalyst Score (Weight: 10%)

### 7. Liquidity Score (Weight: 5%)

**Composite Score = Weighted average of all 7 scores**

## 🎨 Customization Examples

### For Aggressive Momentum Trading
Edit `config.py`:
```python
'weights': {
    'momentum_score': 0.35,      # More weight on trends
    'volume_score': 0.25,        # More weight on activity
    'technical_score': 0.20,
    'catalyst_score': 0.15,      # More weight on news
    'volatility_score': 0.05,    # Less concern about volatility
}
```

### For Conservative Technical Trading
```python
'weights': {
    'technical_score': 0.35,     # Focus on indicators
    'volatility_score': 0.20,    # Prefer stable movers
    'liquidity_score': 0.15,     # Need good fills
    'momentum_score': 0.20,
    'relative_strength_score': 0.10,
}
```

### Adjust Filters
```python
ANALYSIS_CONFIG = {
    'min_avg_volume': 500000,    # Higher liquidity requirement
    'min_price': 5.0,            # Avoid penny stocks
    'max_price': 500,            # Avoid high-priced stocks
}
```

## 🎓 Tips for Success

### Getting Started
1. Start with the sample input file (10 stocks)
2. Review results to understand scoring
3. Adjust weights based on your style
4. Test with your actual screener results

### Ongoing Use
1. Run analysis consistently (daily)
2. Track which scores correlate with your wins
3. Adjust weights quarterly based on performance
4. Combine with your own technical analysis

### Optimization
1. Pre-filter your screener for basic criteria
2. Focus on 50-150 stocks per run
3. Use top 10 as watchlist, deep dive on top 3-5
4. Don't blindly follow scores - use as starting point

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Limitations
- Scores are quantitative - don't replace qualitative analysis
- News sentiment is keyword-based (not AI)
- Historical data only - can't predict black swans
- Works best combined with chart analysis

### API Considerations
- Free tier: 250 requests/day, 5 req/sec
- ~50 stocks per day on free tier
- Paid tiers offer higher limits
- Script respects rate limits automatically

### Risk Disclaimer
- Not financial advice
- For educational purposes only
- Always do your own research
- Past performance ≠ future results
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
